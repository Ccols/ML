function A_hat = NearestSPD(A)
% nearestSPD - the nearest (in Frobenius norm) Symmetric Positive Definite matrix to A
% usage: A_hat = nearestSPD(A)
%
% From Higham: "The nearest symmetric positive semidefinite matrix in the
% Frobenius norm to an arbitrary real matrix A is shown to be (B + H)/2,
% where H is the symmetric polar factor of B=(A + A')/2."

% arguments: (input)
%  A - square matrix, which will be converted to the nearest Symmetric
%    Positive Definite Matrix.
%
% Arguments: (output)
%  A_hat - The matrix chosen as the nearest SPD matrix to A.
